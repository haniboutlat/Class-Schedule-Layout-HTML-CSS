# Project Overview
This project is a fully styled school timetable layout built with HTML and CSS, displaying a weekly class schedule for a specific class group. The page uses a structured grid of days, time slots, and subjects to clearly present lessons, teachers, and room information in a visually organized format.​

## Features
- Weekly overview with columns for each weekday and rows for all lesson hours.​
- Color-coded subjects (e.g. Nederlands, Wiskunde, Informatica) to visually distinguish different courses.​
- Clear separation of morning, midday break, and afternoon lessons using borders and layout blocks.​
- Flexbox-based alignment for rows of days and lesson containers, ensuring a clean and consistent structure.​

 ## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Semantic page structure for the timetable, headings, and lesson cells.​
- CSS3 – Flexbox layout, borders, spacing, typography, and background colors for subjects and time slots.​

## Layout and Responsiveness
- The layout uses Flexbox for rows of weekdays and lesson containers, allowing elements to align neatly across the full width of the page. Font sizes and cell heights are defined using viewport units so the timetable scales proportionally with the screen size.​

## How to Run
- Download or clone the project files into a folder on your computer.
- Ensure css_positionering_03.html and stylesheet.css are in the same directory.​
- Open css_positionering_03.html in any modern web browser to view the timetable.​
